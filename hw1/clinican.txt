1.
check kmalloc pointer, whether or not it's null. Handle the exception
compare function-
  check if null
simple exit, delete * for all structs
list_for_each_space in exit
kfree, and then set it to null that will erase data after done

kfree(pointer*) 
pointer* = null

2. 
check return value of pthread_create
zero out the data at the end
memset = 0 for that many bytes
handle odd number of threads
